barnowl-hci
===========

__barnowl-hci__ converts RF decodings from the Bluetooth Host Controller Interface (HCI) into software-developer-friendly JSON: a real-time stream of [raddec](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec/) objects which facilitate any and all of the following applications:
- RFID: _what_ is present, based on the device identifier?
- RTLS: _where_ is it relative to the receiving devices?
- M2M: _how_ is its status, based on any payload included in the packet?

__barnowl-hci__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl-hci) that can run on resource-constrained edge devices.  It is typically run behind a [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) instance which is included in the [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) open source middleware suite.


Installation
------------

    npm install barnowl-hci

If installation fails on your system, validate [these installation requirements](#installation-requirements).


Quick Start
-----------

Clone this repository, install package dependencies with `npm install`, and then from the root folder run at any time:

    npm start

If you observe a permissions error (ex: EPERM), either [assign the necessary privileges](#assigning-privileges) (recommended) or run as root (_not_ recommended).  __barnowl-hci__ will set the local Bluetooth radio to scan and print any processed [raddec](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec) data to the console.


Hello barnowl-hci!
------------------

The following code will listen to _simulated_ hardware and output packets to the console:

```javascript
const BarnowlHci = require('barnowl-hci');

let barnowl = new BarnowlHci();

barnowl.addListener(BarnowlHci.TestListener, {});

barnowl.on("raddec", function(raddec) {
  console.log(raddec);
});

barnowl.on("infrastructureMessage", function(message) {
  console.log(message);
});
```

As output you should see a stream of [raddec](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec/) objects similar to the following:

```javascript
{
  transmitterId: "001122334455",
  transmitterIdType: 2,
  rssiSignature: [
    {
      receiverId: "000000000000",
      receiverIdType: 2,
      rssi: -69,
      numberOfDecodings: 1
    }
  ],
  packets: [ '421655daba50e1fe0201050c097265656c79416374697665' ],
  timestamp: 1547693457133
}
```

Regardless of the underlying RF protocol and hardware, the [raddec](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec/) specifies _what_ (transmitterId) is _where_ (receiverId & rssi), as well as _how_ (packets) and _when_ (timestamp).


Is that owl you can do?
-----------------------

While __barnowl-hci__ may suffice standalone for simple real-time applications, its functionality can be greatly extended with the following software packages:
- [advlib](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib) to decode the individual packets from hexadecimal strings into JSON
- [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) to combine parallel streams of RF decoding data in a technology-and-vendor-agnostic way

These packages and more are bundled together as the [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere) open source middleware suite, which includes several __barnowl-x__ listeners.


Supported Listener Interfaces
-----------------------------

The following listener interfaces are supported.

### Socket

Listen on a local Bluetooth HCI interface.  Check the [bluetooth-hci-socket](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@abandonware/bluetooth-hci-socket) package for prerequisites specific to the target platform.  Note that not all platforms are supported.  It may be required to grant additional user privileges, or else run as super user (at your own risk).

```javascript
barnowl.addListener(BarnowlHci.SocketListener, {});
```

### Test

Provides a steady stream of simulated reel packets for testing purposes.

```javascript
barnowl.addListener(BarnowlHci.TestListener, {});
```


Pareto Anywhere Integration
---------------------------

__barnowl-hci__ includes a script to forward data to a local [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) instance as UDP raddecs with target localhost:50001.  Start this script with the command:

    npm run forwarder

See our [Run Pareto Anywhere on a Raspberry Pi](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/pareto-anywhere-pi/#step02) and [Run Pareto Anywhere on a PC](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/pareto-anywhere-pc/#step02) tutorials for instructions on how to run __barnowl-hci__ as a systemd service on boot on a Raspberry Pi or PC, respectively.


Assigning Privileges
--------------------

To start a scan _without_ root privileges, it is necessary to grant __cap_net_raw__ privileges.  For instance, to grant privileges to Node.js so that _any_ Linux user may start a scan, run the following:

    sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)


Installation Requirements
-------------------------

__barnowl-hci__ depends on the [bluetooth-hci-socket](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@abandonware/bluetooth-hci-socket) package which _does not_ support all operating systems.  If your OS _is_ supported but a precompiled binary does not exist, npm will attempt to compile the binary using [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) (which may need to be installed).

On Ubuntu/Debian Linux distributions, if node-gyp throws errors during installation, the _make_ and _g++_ prerequisites for compilation may need to first be installed with `sudo apt install make` and `sudo apt install build-essential` respectively.
